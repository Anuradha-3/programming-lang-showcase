<h4><p><q>Java is an Object-Oriented programming language developed by James Gosling in the early 1990s. The team initiated this project to develop a language for digital devices such as set-top boxes, televisions, etc. Originally, C++ was considered to be used in the project, but the idea was rejected for several reasons(For instance, C++ required more memory). Gosling endeavoured to alter and expand C++; however, before long surrendered that for making another stage called Green.</q></p></h4>
